### BugSwarm

Improving software quality is a central priority of our time.
Approaches to understand, diagnose, localize, and fix software defects 
are usually empirically grounded in datasets of past defects/repairs.
A few such datasets are available; however, these datasets are
difficult to create, and are typically not of the size, scale, and
diversity that is representative of the software in use. 

The goal of **BugSwarm** is to create a **large-scale repository of
replicable defects, tests, and patches** by drawing from the recorded 
history of defects in [GitHub](http://www.github.com) open-source projects.
BugSwarm exploits **continuous integration records of build and
test attempts**, including those that result in build and/or test
failures, and subsequent repairs.

Upon construction, BugSwarm will include **complete virtual machines** to 
reproduce real test failures and bug fixes in thousands of open-source 
projects.
This will facilitate experimentation and avoid the duplication of a 
tremendous amount of work among researchers in programming languages 
and software engineering.
