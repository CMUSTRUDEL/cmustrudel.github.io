					<h4>Motivation</h4>
					<hr>

					<p>
						Based on our collected data, npm has over 500,000 available packages.
						Open source development is massively distributed with little
						central coordination and disparate practices.
						Developers often work in the context of a software ecosystem,
						a complex sociotechnical network of interdependent components, libraries, and plugins,
						many providing similar functionality.
						How do contributors determine if a project is worth contributing to?
						How do users determine which component best suits their needs?
					</p>

					<p>
						The transparency provided by social coding platforms like GitHub
						is essential to such decision making.
						Developers infer the quality of projects by using visible cues,
						known as <i>signals</i>, collected from personal profile
						and repository pages.
					</p>

					<br>
					<br>
					<br>

					<h4>Signaling Theory</h4>
					<hr>

					<p>
						Badges are a type of <b>signal</b>,
						since they provide information on qualities
						such as build status, dependency security, and openness to contributions
						that are otherwise not easily perceivable. 

						That is, badges make certain information about
						a project's code base or practices more transparent.

					</p>

					<p>
						We framed our study in the context of <b>signaling theory</b>,
						which is concerned with the reliability of signals.
						Can you expect that a project is more likely to write tests
						if they display a quality assurance (e.g. continuous integration) badge?
						Is a project actually more likely to keep its dependencies
						up-to-date if it displays a dependency monitoring badge?
					</p>

					<p>
						This is called <b>signal fit</b> &mdash; to what extent do signals (badges)
						correspond to the quality they are meant to signal?
					</p>

					<p>
						We are concerned with two types of signals:<br>
						<b>conventional signals</b>, which simply provide information or a statement of intent;<br>
						<b>assessment signals</b>, which are associated with a third-party service that computes some property
						of the project (such as test coverage).

				<h4>Why use badges?</h4>
					<hr>
					<p>
						To learn why developers use badges &mdash; what qualities they intend to signal &mdash;
						and how contributors interpret those signals,
						we conducted a survey of npm package maintainers and contributors.
						We received 32 contributor and 55 maintainer responses.
					</p>

					<p>
						88% of maintainers agreed that the presence of badges is an indicator of project quality, while only 53% of contributors agreed with the same statement.
						61% of contributors stated that badges do not influence their decision to contribute to projects.
					</p>

					<p>
						All maintainers and most contributors
						mentioned quality assurance badges (those relating to
						continuous integration, test coverage, and static analysis).
						Maintainers stated that they intend to signal
						code and development quality with these badges,
						and more generally that their code was <i>"built with love"</i>
						or <i>"well-written"</i> by an <i>"experienced developer"</i>.
					</p>

					<h4>Badge Adoption</h4>
					<hr>

					<p>
						46% of packages on npm use at least one badge.
						We identified 88 types of badges and split them into six classes based
						on the service they are associted with (see above).

					</p>

					<p>
						Most prevalent is the Travis CI build status badge <img class="inline" src="../../assets/fig/build-passing.svg" />, appearing on 31.5% of projects.
						Also common are badges showing dependency status (David DM) <img class="inline" src="../../assets/fig/david.svg" />  and npm version number <img class="inline" src="../../assets/fig/gh-release.svg" />.
					</p>

					<p>
						From frequent itemset mining, the most common pair of badges is <img class="inline" src="../../assets/fig/build-passing.svg" /><img class="inline" src="../../assets/fig/gh-release.svg" />. The most common triple is <img class="inline" src="../../assets/fig/build-passing.svg" /><img class="inline" src="../../assets/fig/david.svg" /><img class="inline" src="../../assets/fig/gh-release.svg" />.

					<h4>Signals of Updated Dependencies</h4>
					<hr>
					
					<blockquote>
						 <i>
						 	"Knowing whether dependencies are out-of-date and/or contain vulnerabilities is critical information to consumers/users".
						</i>
					</blockquote>

					<p>
						We created a metric of dependency up-to-dateness, or <b>freshness</b>, based on previous work.
						Essentially, it measures the number of releases between the used version and the most up-to-date-version;
						major releases are given 20 points, minor releases 5 points, and patches one point.
						Hence, a <i>lower score is better</i>, with zero being completely up-to-date.
					</p>

					<img src="../../assets/fig/freshness2.png" class="float-right" style="height: 175px;" />

					<p>
						Overall, we found that at the time of this study, projects with dependency manager or information badges
						had significantly fresher dependencies than those without. Surprisingly, the effect was more
						pronounced for information badges.
					</p>


					<p>
						Measuring freshness over a 19-month interval, we found that the adoption of a badge (in purple)
						correlates with <i>improved freshness</i>. The effect lasts longer for dependency manager badges,
						such as David DM <img class="inline" src="../../assets/fig/david.svg" />, than for information badges.
					</p>

					<h4>Signals of Popularity</h4>
					<hr>

					<blockquote>
						Some maintainers mentioned that signaling package popularity
						<i>"instills confidence in new users"</i>
						and helps to decide between similar packages through
						the <i>"wisdom of the crowd"</i>.
					</blockquote>

					<p>
						We inflation-adjusted monthly download count history to account for npm's natural growth.
					</p>

					<img src="../../assets/fig/popularity_monthly.png" class="float-right" style="height: 175px;" />

					<p>
						Looking at the download counts in the month prior to the study,
						we found that packages with badges tend to be more popular.
						Quality assurance and popularity badges <img src="../../assets/fig/npm-downloads.svg" class="inline" /> are associated with
						larger effects than information badges.
					</p>



					<p>
						The adoption of a project's first badge is correlated with a small increase in popularity,
					but the growth in popularity is not sustained in the future.

					<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
						<strong>In summary:</strong> The adoption of a badge does not change popularity. However,

					<h4>Signals of Test Suite Quality</h4>
					<hr>

					<blockquote>
						Maintainers use quality assurance badges to signal development quality, such as <i>"having tests and running them regularly"</i>.
					</blockquote>

					<p>
						We measured a project's proportion of tests over time (test suite size / project size),
						only including projects that have tests in the longitudinal analysis.
					</p>

					<img src="../../assets/fig/test_bytes3.png" class="float-right" style="height: 175px;" />

					<p>
						Many projects have no tests. Hence, the distribution of test suite sizes
						is bimodal (see right). It appears that packages with
						quality assurance badges <i>and</i> those with information
						badges tend to have larger test suites.
					</p>

					<p>
						Though it is barely visible in the graph, statistical modeling confirms that there is, on average, a small
						increase in the proportion of tests around the time of quality assurance badge adoption.
						The effect does not persist over time.
					</p>


					<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
						<strong>In summary:</strong> Quality assurance badges are correlated with projects having more tests, though they are not correlated with lasting changes in testing practices.

					<h4>Signals of Better Contributions</h4>
					<hr>

					<blockquote>
						With a coverage badge,
						<i>"PRs with new functionality tend to include new tests, as not to decrease coverage"</i>
					</blockquote>

					<p>
						We hypothesized that quality assurance badges, particularly those associated with test coverage like Coveralls <img class="inline" src="../../assets/fig/coveralls.svg" />, would be correlated with a higher incidence of tests in pull requests. That is, pull requests are more likely to contain changes to the test suite.	
					</p>

					<img src="../../assets/fig/pr_tests.png" class="float-right" style="height: 175px;" />

					<p>
					By direct comparison using data from the month prior to the study, it can be seen that projects with badges
					tend to have a higher fraction of pull requests with tests than those without.
					</p>


					<p>
						After the adoption of a quality assurance badge, we see an increase in the incidence of pull requests containing tests. The effect slowly decays, however. Statistical modeling suggests that this decay is slower if a coverage badge is included.
					</p>
