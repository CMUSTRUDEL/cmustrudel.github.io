### Sustainability of open-source ecosystems

While only twenty years ago open-source software was simply a curiosity that 
attracted the attention of a few academics and was not seriously considered 
in the software industry, **open-source infrastructure today is ubiquitous**, 
powering applications in virtually every domain. 

Economists refer to open-source software as **digital dark matter**, to signify 
both its invisibility and importance. They also report valuations of open-source
software in the billions of dollars per year, in terms of both direct reuse 
value and boosted productivity and efficiency.

Given the importance of open-source digital infrastructure to so much of the 
economy, one might expect that it is adequately staffed and maintained, i.e., 
sustainable. Yet, this is often not the case. As a recent 
[Ford Foundation report](https://www.fordfoundation.org/about/library/reports-and-studies/roads-and-bridges-the-unseen-labor-behind-our-digital-infrastructure/) 
investigating the sustainability of open-source digital infrastructure notes, 
**most users of open-source infrastructure take it for granted**, and **society 
at large is unaware of the risks**.

In this project we study ways to increase the sustainability of open-source
digital infrastructure.

Here's a [recent talk](../../slides/zurich-sustainability.pdf) outlining some 
of the **sustainability challenges** that open-source ecosystems face today.
