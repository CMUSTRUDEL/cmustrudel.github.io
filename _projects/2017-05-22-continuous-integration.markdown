### Continuous Integration in GitHub

Software processes comprise many steps; coding is followed by building, 
integration testing, system testing, deployment, operations, among others. 
Software **process integration and automation** have been areas of key concern 
in software engineering, ever since the pioneering work of Osterweil; 
market pressures for Agility, and open, decentralized, software development 
have provided additional pressures for progress in this area. 

But **do these innovations actually help projects**? Given the numerous 
confounding factors that can influence project performance, it can be a 
challenge to discern the effects of process integration and automation. 

Software project ecosystems such as GitHub provide a new opportunity in 
this regard: one can readily find large numbers of projects in various stages 
of process integration and automation, and gather data on various influencing 
factors as well as productivity and quality outcomes. 
We use large, **historical data on process metrics and outcomes** in 
GitHub projects to discern the effects of one specific innovation in process 
automation: **continuous integration**. 

Our main finding is that continuous integration improves the productivity 
of project teams, who can integrate more outside contributions, without an 
observable diminishment in code quality.
