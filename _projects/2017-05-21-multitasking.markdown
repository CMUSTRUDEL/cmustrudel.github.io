### Multitasking across GitHub projects

Software development has always inherently required multitasking: developers 
switch between coding, reviewing, testing, designing, and meeting with 
colleagues. The advent of software ecosystems like **GitHub** has enabled 
something new: the ability to easily switch between projects. Developers 
also have social incentives to contribute to many projects; for example, 
prolific contributors can gain social recognition and (eventually) economic 
rewards. 

Multitasking, however, comes at a **cognitive cost**: frequent context-switches 
can lead to distraction, sub-standard work, and even greater stress. 
Using ecosystem-level data on GitHub programmers working on a large collection 
of projects, we develop models and methods for measuring the rate and breadth 
of a developers' **context-switching behavior**; Using these, we study how 
context-switching affects developer **productivity**.

We find that the most common reason for multitasking is interrelationships 
and dependencies between projects. Notably, we find that the rate of switching 
and breadth (number of projects) of a developerâ€™s work matter. Developers who 
work on many projects have **higher productivity if they focus on few 
projects per day**. Developers that **switch projects too much during the 
course of a day have lower productivity** as they work on more projects overall.
