To prepare myself for next year's SCS trivia and to demostrate my school pride,
I set up a one trivia a day challenge for myself. 
My plan is to continue this until I leave CMU.
All the trivias will be related to CMU or Computer Science in general. 
This year's SCS trivia night made me realize how little I know about female
computer scientist, so I will focus
more on this part.

I learned many of Computer Science related trivia from "Great Moments in
Computing", a great course offered at
Princeton University taught by Professor Maragret Martonosi.
Many CMU related trivias are learned by wandering in campus during work breaks.

Let the first trivia be our most familiar program, <b>hello world</b>.

From left to right: Dr. Dennis Ritchie, Ken Tompson, and Dr. Brian Kernighan.

<b>Dr. Dennis Ritchie</b> developed the language <b>C</b>, which he used to
implement the operating system <b>Unix</b> with <b>Ken Thompson</b>.
To educate people how to use C, 
<b>Dr. Brian Kernighan</b> wrote the textbook <i>The C Programming Language</i> 
and used the program hello world as an introductory example. This was the first
apperance of the hello world program. 
Ever since then, most beginners' first program in many languages have been some
variation of: 

`main()

{

    printf("hello, world\n");

}`

Dr. Brian Kernighan is now a professor at <b>Princeton University</b>.

Before Unix, there was an operating system called <b>MULTICS</b>(<b>Mult<b>iplexed
<b>I<b>nformation and <b>C<b>omputing <b>S</b>ervice), developed by <b>MIT, GE,
and Bell Lab</b> and released in <b>1969</b>.
You can read the original paper here: <a
href="https://www.classes.cs.uchicago.edu/archive/2017/fall/33100-1/papers/multics.pdf">Virtual
Memory, Processes, and Sharing in MULTICS</a> by <b>Robert C. Daley and Jack B.
Dennis</b>.
The main concepts introduced with MULTICS are <b>Proccess</b> and <b>Address
space</b>.
Quoting from the paper:

> Processes stand in one-to-one correspondence
with virtual memories. Each process runs in
its own address space, which is established independently
of other address spaces. Processes are run on a processor
at the discretion of the tra~h'c controller module of the
supervisor. 

These concepts are still prevalent today.
