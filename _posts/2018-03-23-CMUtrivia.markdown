To prepare myself for next year's SCS trivia and to demostrate my school pride,
I set up a one trivia a day challenge for myself. 
All the trivias will be related to CMU or Computer Science in general. 
This year's SCS trivia night made me realize how little I know about female
computer scientist, so I will focus
more on this part.

Let the first trivia be our most familiar program, <b>hello world</b>. 

<b>Dennis Ritchie</b> developed the language <b>C</b>, which he used to
implement the operating system <b>Unix</b> with <b>Ken Thompson</b>.
To educate people how to use C, 
<b>Brian Kernighan</b> wrote the textbook <i>The C Programming Language</i> 
and used the program hello world as an introductory example. This was the first
apperance of the hello world program. 
Ever since then, most beginners' first program in many languages have been some
variation of: 

`main()
{
    printf("hello, world\n");
}`

Dr. Brian Kernighan is now a professor at <b>Princeton University</b>.
