Since I came to the Open House in March 2017, I found that CMU is a nerdy but
cool space. 
People are smart and creative. As a result, my life at CMU has been full of
funny anecdots.
I wanted to share some of them that made me burst into laughter. 

Feb 14, 2018.

My office mate brought the the issue of Valentine's Day plan when she was
working with her collaborator. She told us if you brought your laptop to the
bookstore, they would clean it for free. 

People celebrate Valentine's Day with their valentines. Same here at CMU.
However, CMU might have defined valentine slightly differently. It expanded the
concept beyond human beings. Apart from your collaborators, people usually
interact the most  
with their valentines. If we count objects as well, one's laptop 
is definitely the number 1 valentine.
