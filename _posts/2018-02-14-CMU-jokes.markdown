Since I came to the Open House in March 2017, I found that CMU is a nerdy but
cool space. 
People are smart and creative. As a result, my life at CMU has been full of
funny anecdots.
I wanted to share some of them that made me burst into laughter.

This is not a joke. It is serious. 

Today is International Women's Day. In China, where I grew up, people
celebrate it as a festival.   
On wechat, many of my girl friends posted photos of chocolates and roses they
received from their boyfriends/husbands/employers as gifts.
Doesn't it sound like Valentine's Day?

IMHO, CMU has found the correct way of celebrating Women's Day. International
Women's Day is more about reminding us of the history of women's struggle for
equality than treating women better in this single day.

It so happend that we read the paper "<a
href="http://hci.stanford.edu/publications/2016/ethan/gender.pdf">Shirtless and Dangerous: Quantifying
Linguistic Signals of Gender Bias in an Online Fiction Writing Community</a>" (Fast
et al. ICWSM. 2016) in our social computing reading group today (organized by
students at LTI and HCII). Although my limited literature background tells me
that word level analysis for bias detection is too superficial, I still endorse
this paper because it discovers that female authors are equally likely to
conform with gender stereotypes in their writings.

I was surprised by how often I can spot a Harry Potter related thing on CMU
campus. I was even more surprised when I found out that there would be a Harry
Potter themed shabbat at Hillel Jewish University Center.

When I arrived at the front desk, there was a "sorting hat" from which you can
draw an image of a house's badge. This "sorting ceremony" decides which table
you will sit at. I was "sorted" into Ravenclaw, although I was wearing
Gryffindor gears. All three other houses' tables are quickly filled, except for
ours. By the time dinner started, we only had 3 people. The organizer said,
"Maybe Ravenclaws are still studying." That sounds like what CMU students are
doing all the time. No wonder most students in our Harry Potter course identify
them with Ravenclaw.

I can never forget how delicious their bread was!

And here's a trivia:

Name a jewish student at Hogwarts.

My office mate told us if you brought your laptop to the
bookstore, they would clean it for free.

People celebrate Valentine's Day with their valentines. Same here at CMU.
However, CMU might have defined valentine slightly differently. It expanded the
concept beyond human beings. Apart from your collaborators, people usually
interact the most with their valentines. If we count objects as well, one's laptop 
is definitely the number 1 valentine of most CMU students.

You can find interesting things in restrooms! Here's what I found in girls'
restroom on 5th floor in Gates:

<img src="/assets/img/pics/09-28-17-boysclub.jpg" style="width: 400px;"/>

Although it sounds great, I think they should have put it in boys' restroom or
on a public wall. I believe the intention was to encourage
women to pursue computer science if that's what they have been wanted to do. But
the point I wanted to make is that women, maybe especially female graduate
students, here at CMU are already brave enough to make it this far. We should
not only focus on encouraging women, but also educate our male colleagues and
build a friendly environment where woment don't have to be encouraged to pursue
their favourite subject. If CMU CS is gender inclusive, women can feel it. We
don't need to be reminded by a sign in a single restroom. If gender
inclusiveness is something that CMU CS is proud of, then I wish to see this sign
in a public space.

Hey, have you pulled an all-nighter? NO?? You were too busy sleeping and forgot
to stay awake all night pretending to work hard? Well, when you walk into the
classroom, everyone will look like a panda except for you. You will look like an
outsider!

Don't worry. We've got you covered. If you go to the girls' restroom on the 4th
floor in Gates, you will see everything you need. Free of charge.

Happy smiley's 35's birthday!

Do you know who invented :-)? Where was :-) first used? 

On 19 Sep, 1982, way before the emoji era, Scott Fahlman at CMU decided that people should use :-) for happy
feeling and :-( for sad feeling. When they could only communicate through plain
text, this was the cleverest idea. Now we have emoji, but I'd say text emoticons
are still very useful and efficient. <a href="http://cool-smileys.com/text-emoticons">Here's a
list of text emoticons</a>. \(^o^)/ (◕‿◕✿) 

BTW, do you know why CMU's computer science ranks 1st? Because we invented bug
swatter that can help our students quickly identify bugs so as to accelerate our
research progress!
