Jeremy Lacomis presented the paper <a
href="https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~weimerw/p/weimer-icse2017-preprint.pdf">Decoding the representation of code in the
brain: An fMRI study of code review and expertise</a> (Floyd et al.
Proc. of ICSE 175-186(2017)). The researchers
scanned participants brain while they were reviewing code or prose. The
