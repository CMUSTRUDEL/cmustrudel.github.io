Alan Jaffe presented the paper <a
href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.09492.pdf">Automatically Generating Commit Messages
from Diffs Using Neural Machine Translation</a> (Jiang et al., ASE
2017). It is an interesting application of the naturalness of code. I
learned a lot about the idea of naturalness of code, as well as the fact
that Alan is very good at baking pumpkin pies.

No meeting this week. STRUDEL was away attending 
<a href="http://ase2017.org">ASE</a> in Urbana-Champaign, IL and visiting
Fiona at the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/cincinnatizoo/">Cincinnati Zoo</a>.

STRUDEL was proud to host <a href="http://www.win.tue.nl/~aserebre/">Alexander 
Serebrenik</a> from TU Eindhoven, who talked about his recent work on mining 
emotions from software engineering artifacts.
We were all enjoying his talk as well as Sophie's hazelnut wafel.

Sophie presented the paper "<a
href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~fmri/plosone/files/hp_PLOS_ONE.pdf">Simultaneously
Uncovering the Patterns of
Brain Regions Involved in Different Story
Reading Subprocesses</a>" (Wehbe et al., PLoS ONE 2014). 
The researchers scanned participants brains while they were reading
the ninth chapter of <i>Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone</i>. They
then trained a classifier that can distinguish which short passage the
participants were reading based on the neural activity. The choice of
this paper was to present group members another machine learning
classifier that can process fMRI results. 
It was very nice and sweet that David made apple raisin strudels.

Marat presented the paper "<a
href="http://delivery.acm.org/10.1145/2540000/2531642/p831-backstrom.pdf?ip=24.238.13.130&id=2531642&acc=OA&key=4D4702B0C3E38B35%2E4D4702B0C3E38B35%2E4D4702B0C3E38B35%2E528920FC4509E774&CFID=993659916&CFTOKEN=60398709&__acm__=1509333674_18432c45ea35e7515bb15ff9492d27f0">Romantic partnerships and the
dispersion of social ties: a network analysis of relationship status on
facebook</a>" (Backstrom et al, CSCW 2014). This paper proposed to use
dispersion, which measures "the extent to which two people's mutual
friends are not themselves well-connected," in addition to embeddedness,
which measures the number of mutural friends, to predict if two Facebook users 
are in a romantic relationship. The accuracy of prediction increased 
significantly when using the dispersion metric.
Somehow, my impression of the paper smells like homemade banana bread.

David presented the paper "<a
href="https://yuchi1989.github.io/papers/fse17-ErrDoc.pdf">Automatically
Diagnosing and Repairing Error Handling Bugs in C</a>" (Tian and Ray, ESEC/FSE 2017). 
This paper presents how to identify different types of bugs and how to correct
them in C/C++ code. 
Happy Mid-autumn festival and thanks Sophie for her mooncake!

Jeremy presented the paper "<a
href="https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~weimerw/p/weimer-icse2017-preprint.pdf">Decoding the representation of code in the
brain: An fMRI study of code review and expertise</a>" (Floyd et al, ICSE 2017). 
The researchers scanned participants' brain while they were reviewing code or 
prose. The findings suggest that reading code differs from reading natural 
language, but less so for experts than for novices.

We had our first reading group meeting today! To celebrate, Bogdan brought 
apple-cinnamon strudels for us. Nevertheless, these strudles were not as
good as our discussion on the paper "<a
href="http://people.cs.umass.edu/~ameli/projects/fairness/papers/discriminationTesting.pdf">Fairness Testing: 
Testing Software for Discrimination</a>" (Galhotra et al, ESEC/FSE 2017) that 
Bogdan presented at the meeting.
