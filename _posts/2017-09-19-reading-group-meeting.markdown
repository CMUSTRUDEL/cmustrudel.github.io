Jeremy Lacomis presented the paper <b><a
href="https://hal.inria.fr/hal-01691496/file/SEIP_63_Camera-Ready-no-copyright.pdf">How
to Design a Program Repair Bot? Insights from
the Repairnator Project</a></b> (Urli et al. ICSE 2018).

It is interesting to learn about online program repair bugs. When I was talking
with a CMU undergrad at one of <a
href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/cmukgb/">KGB</a>'s activity, he was excited
to learn that people are working on how to fix bugs automatically since he has
some very unpleasant experience with debugging - so do many of us. It would be
great if we could have a bug repairing bot with high accuracy in the future.
However, as Marat pointed out, when the debugging process can be largely
substituted by a robot, that means this language is dying. One example is
Assembly. Here's a quote from Paul Graham
about the evolution of programming languages:

"What programmers in a hundred years will be looking for, most of all, is a
language where you can throw together an unbelievably inefficient version 1 of a
program with the least possible effort. At least, that's how we'd describe it in
present-day terms. What they'll say is that they want a language that's easy to
program in.

Inefficient software isn't gross. What's gross is a language that makes
programmers do needless work. Wasting programmer time is the true inefficiency,
not wasting machine time. This will become ever more clear as computers get
faster." (source: <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/hundred.html">http://www.paulgraham.com/hundred.html</a>)

Jason Yanwen Lin presented the paper
<b><a
href="http://haiyizhu.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/predicting-member-productivity-1.pdf">Predicting
Member Productivity and Withdrawal from
Pre-Joining Attachments in Online Production Groups</a></b> (Yu et al. CSCW 17).

This paper analysed withdrawl from Wikipedia groups using the attachment
theories from social psychology. 
There results show that pre-joining connections are important to online
production groups. Speaking from my personal experience, I totally agree with
the authors. Especially in online community, when you often interact with people
who you don't konw much personal information, it can be hard to form attachment.

Shurui Zhou presented the paper <b><a
href="http://gustavopinto.org/lost+found/icse2018.pdf">Almost There: A Study on
Quasi-Contributors in Open-Source Software Projects</a></b> (Steinmarcher et al.,
ICSE 2018). 

It was interesting to learn that many people stopped making further
contribution on GitHub after their first pull request was rejected. We also felt
that there would be many future work worth pursuing. Thanks Shurui's
presentation as well as her snacks.

Since it was Alex's meeting before he became a
professor in Estonia, he also brought some
pastries from Gates. We appreciated his intention of getting us fat. We will
miss you.

By the way, I think Gates' blueberry muffin is very nice, as well as banana &
nuts in Scott. Nevertheless, no muffin compares to thos in Brown's Blue Room or
banana muffin at Corner Bakery Cafe.

#### Wednesday, Janurary 14, 2018

David Widder presented the paper <b><a
href="https://ir.library.oregonstate.edu/downloads/wh246x964">Open Source
barriers to entry, revisited: A tools perspective</a></b> (Mendez et al. ICSE 2018).

Professor Margaret Burnett's team has been studying GitHub's gender inclusive
issues. Since men and women are biologically different statistically, tools
should be designed to cater their different ways of thinking and engaging with
software. I do not think software developing is an inheritly male dominated task. I
believe that getting
more women into software developing is a key to gender equality. Yes, I am a
feminist.

Davis is very good at baking, but I think he should have given out his delicious
brownies at the beginning of his presentation rather than at the end.

#### Thusday, December 5, 2017

Sophie Qiu presented the paper <b><a
href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1071581916301033">The influence of visual feedback and
gender dynamics on performance,
perception and communication strategies in CSCW</a></b> (Koulouri et al.
International Journal of Human-Computer Studies 2017).

This paper shows that while men are statistically better at navigation with help
from visual signals, women can use verbal communication to compensate such
weakness and achieve the same level of excellency in navitation tasks.
GenderMag, which David Widder will present later, is in the same mindset that
although men and women are statistically biologically different, well-designed
tools can help both of them succeed.

Sophie did not know that green been pie could contain cream so she bought a lot
of them. Luckily, she could bring them to Strudel meetings so that everyone can
eat them and be merry.

Bogdan Vasilescu presented the paper <b><a
href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8031982/">Code Coverage and Postrelease
Defects: A Large-Scale Study on Open Source Projects</a></b> (Kochhar et al. 2017). 

This paper shows that code coverage in testing has insignificant correlation
with the number of bugs at the project level of a software. Then my question
was: how much test would be sufficient if a large software project could never be
bug-free?

I do not remember what snack we had during that meeting.

#### Tuesday, November 21, 2017

Shurui Zhou presented the paper <b><a
href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3104225">Some from here, some from
there: cross-project code reuse in GitHub</a></b> (Gharehyazie et al., MSR 2017).

This paper reminds me of two most popular ways of coding: Google-oriented coding
and stackoverflow-oriented coding. It is expensive to write code from scratch,
so understanding how code pieces are cloned across projects is useful.

I do not quite remember the snack but it might be Shurui's Choco Pie.

#### Tuesday, November 14, 2017

Alexander Nolte presented the paper <b><a href="http://hci.stanford.edu/publications/2017/flashorgs/flash-orgs-chi-2017.pdf">Flash Organizations:
Crowdsourcing Complex Work by Structuring Crowds As Organizations</a></b>.

It is a nice paper on how to more effectively form an software developing group.
It was good to read some paper on HCI, which I was fascinated in but knew very
little about.

Thanks for your cookies, Alex. I guess they came from La Prima Espresso in
WEAN.

#### Tuesday, November 7, 2017 

Alan Jaffe presented the paper <b><a
href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.09492.pdf">Automatically Generating Commit Messages
from Diffs Using Neural Machine Translation</a></b> (Jiang et al., ASE
2017). 

It is an interesting application of the naturalness of code. I
learned a lot about the idea of naturalness of code, as well as the fact
that Alan is very good at baking pumpkin pies.

No meeting this week. STRUDEL was away attending 
<a href="http://ase2017.org">ASE</a> in Urbana-Champaign, IL and visiting
Fiona at the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/cincinnatizoo/">Cincinnati Zoo</a>.

STRUDEL was proud to host <b><a href="http://www.win.tue.nl/~aserebre/">Alexander 
Serebrenik</a></b> from TU Eindhoven, who talked about his recent work on mining 
emotions from software engineering artifacts.
We were all enjoying his talk as well as Sophie's hazelnut wafel.

#### Tuesday, October 17, 2017

Sophie presented the paper <b><a
href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~fmri/plosone/files/hp_PLOS_ONE.pdf">Simultaneously
Uncovering the Patterns of
Brain Regions Involved in Different Story
Reading Subprocesses</a></b> (Wehbe et al., PLoS ONE 2014). 

The researchers scanned participants brains while they were reading
the ninth chapter of <i>Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone</i>. They
then trained a classifier that can distinguish which short passage the
participants were reading based on the neural activity. The choice of
this paper was to present group members another machine learning
classifier that can process fMRI results. 
It was very nice and sweet that David made apple raisin strudels.

#### Tuesday, October 10, 2017

Marat presented the paper <b><a
href="http://delivery.acm.org/10.1145/2540000/2531642/p831-backstrom.pdf?ip=24.238.13.130&id=2531642&acc=OA&key=4D4702B0C3E38B35%2E4D4702B0C3E38B35%2E4D4702B0C3E38B35%2E528920FC4509E774&CFID=993659916&CFTOKEN=60398709&__acm__=1509333674_18432c45ea35e7515bb15ff9492d27f0">Romantic partnerships and the
dispersion of social ties: a network analysis of relationship status on
facebook</a></b> (Backstrom et al, CSCW 2014). 

This paper proposed to use
dispersion, which measures "the extent to which two people's mutual
friends are not themselves well-connected," in addition to embeddedness,
which measures the number of mutural friends, to predict if two Facebook users 
are in a romantic relationship. The accuracy of prediction increased 
significantly when using the dispersion metric.
Somehow, my impression of the paper smells like homemade banana bread.


#### Tuesday, October 3, 2017

David presented the paper <b><a
href="https://yuchi1989.github.io/papers/fse17-ErrDoc.pdf">Automatically
Diagnosing and Repairing Error Handling Bugs in C</a></b> (Tian and Ray, ESEC/FSE 2017). 

This paper presents how to identify different types of bugs and how to correct
them in C/C++ code. 
Happy Mid-autumn festival and thanks Sophie for her mooncake!

#### Tuesday, September 26, 2017

Jeremy presented the paper <b><a
href="https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~weimerw/p/weimer-icse2017-preprint.pdf">Decoding the representation of code in the
brain: An fMRI study of code review and expertise</a></b> (Floyd et al, ICSE 2017). 


The researchers scanned participants' brain while they were reviewing code or 
prose. The findings suggest that reading code differs from reading natural 
language, but less so for experts than for novices.

#### Tuesday, September 19, 2017

We had our first reading group meeting today! To celebrate, Bogdan brought 
apple-cinnamon strudels for us. Nevertheless, these strudles were not as
good as our discussion on the paper <b><a
href="http://people.cs.umass.edu/~ameli/projects/fairness/papers/discriminationTesting.pdf">Fairness Testing: 
Testing Software for Discrimination</a></b> (Galhotra et al, ESEC/FSE 2017) that 
Bogdan presented at the meeting.
