Marat Valiev presented the paper <a
href="http://delivery.acm.org/10.1145/2540000/2531642/p831-backstrom.pdf?ip=24.238.13.130&id=2531642&acc=OA&key=4D4702B0C3E38B35%2E4D4702B0C3E38B35%2E4D4702B0C3E38B35%2E528920FC4509E774&CFID=993659916&CFTOKEN=60398709&__acm__=1509333674_18432c45ea35e7515bb15ff9492d27f0">Romantic partnerships and the
dispersion of social ties: a network analysis of relationship status on
facebook</a> (Backstrom et al. Proc. of CSCW 831-841(2014)). This paper proposed to use
dispersion, which measures "the extent to which two people's mutual
friends are not themselves well-connected," in addition to embeddedness,
which measures the number of mutural friends, to
predict if two people are in a romantic relationship. The accuracy of
prediction increased significantly when using the dispersion metric.
