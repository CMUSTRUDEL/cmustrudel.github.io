Sophie Qiu presented the paper <a
href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~fmri/plosone/files/hp_PLOS_ONE.pdf">Simultaneously
Uncovering the Patterns of
Brain Regions Involved in Different Story
Reading Subprocesses</a> Wehbe et al. PLoS ONE 9(11) (2014). 
The researchers scanned participants brains while they were reading
the ninth chapter of <i>Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone</i>. They
then trained a classifier that can distinguish which short passage the
participants were reading based on the neural activity. The choice of
this paper was to present group members another machine learning
classifier that can process fMRI results.
