                <p>Since I came to the Open House in March 2017, I found that CMU is a nerdy but
cool space. 
I’m writing down things I find interesting here.
Hope this blog can tell you more about CMU.</p>

<h4 id="mar-18-2018">Mar 18, 2018.</h4>

<p><b>His heart is at work.</b></p>

<p>While most people were away last week because of the spring break, this guy sat
at the teaching common the entire week. Apparantly, his heart is at work.
A typical CMU student.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/pics/03-18-18-atwork1.jpg" style="width: 400px;" />

<p><b>Physicist Stephen Hawking died at the age of 76 on Pie Day</b></p>

<p>When the east coast was entering pie day, I heard that we lost Professor Stephen Hawking.
Pie day is special not only because it is 3.14. It is also Einstein’s birthday.
This year, it has also become Hawking’s death date.
I still remember, when Professor Hawking’s books were translated into Chinese,
TV programs were repeating over and over again that Profssor Hawking was born on
the day on which Galileo Galilei died. 
Maybe great minds are always connected.</p>

<p>Speaking of Professor Hawking’s science, I thought of a comic
sticked outside the office of Professor Thomas Ferguson, who helped construct
Large Hadron Collider (LHC), in Wean Hall.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/pics/03-14-18-lhc.jpg" style="width: 400px;" /></p>

<h4 id="mar-2-2018">Mar 2, 2018.</h4>

<p><b>Harry Potter Shabbat</b></p>

<p>I was surprised by how often I could spot a Harry Potter related thing on CMU
campus. I was even more surprised when I found out that there would be a Harry
Potter themed shabbat at Hillel Jewish University Center.</p>

<p>When I arrived at the front desk, there was a “sorting hat” from which you can
draw an image of a house’s badge. This “sorting ceremony” decides which table
you will sit at. I was “sorted” into Ravenclaw, although I was wearing
Gryffindor gears. All three other houses’ tables are quickly filled, except for
ours. By the time dinner started, we only had 3 people. The organizer said,
“Maybe Ravenclaws are still studying.” That sounds like what CMU students are
doing all the time. No wonder most students in our Harry Potter course identify
them with Ravenclaw.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/pics/03-02-18-hpshabbat1.jpg" style="width: 400px;" /></p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/pics/03-02-18-hpshabbat2.jpg" style="width: 400px;" /></p>

<p>I can never forget how delicious their bread was!</p>

<p>And here’s a trivia:</p>

<p>Name a jewish student at Hogwarts.</p>

<h4 id="feb-14-2018">Feb 14, 2018.</h4>

<p><b>Valentine’s Day @ CMU</b></p>

<p>My office mate told us if you brought your laptop to the
bookstore, they would clean it for free.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/pics/02-14-18-valentine.jpg" style="width: 400px;" /></p>

<p>People celebrate Valentine’s Day with their valentines. Same here at CMU.
However, CMU might have defined valentine slightly differently. It expanded the
concept beyond human beings. Apart from your collaborators, people usually
interact the most with their valentines. If we count objects as well, one’s laptop 
is definitely the number 1 valentine of most CMU students.</p>

<p><b>Computer Science at CMU is not just for boys</b></p>

<p>You can find interesting things in restrooms! Here’s what I found in girls’
restroom on 5th floor in Gates:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/pics/09-28-17-boysclub.jpg" style="width: 400px;" /></p>

<p>Although it sounds great, I think they should have put it in boys’ restroom or
on a public wall. I believe the intention was to encourage
women to pursue computer science if that’s what they have been wanted to do. But
the point I wanted to make is that women, maybe especially female graduate
students, here at CMU are already brave enough to make it this far. We should
not only focus on encouraging women, but also educate our male colleagues and
build a friendly environment where woment don’t have to be encouraged to pursue
their favourite subject. If CMU CS is gender inclusive, women can feel it. We
don’t need to be reminded by a sign in a single restroom. If gender
inclusiveness is something that CMU CS is proud of, then I wish to see this sign
in a public space.</p>

<p><b>How to pull an all-nighter in 5 minutes?</b></p>

<p>Hey, have you pulled an all-nighter? NO?? You were too busy sleeping and forgot
to stay awake all night pretending to work hard? Well, when you walk into the
classroom, everyone will look like a panda except for you. You will look like an
outsider!</p>

<p>Don’t worry. We’ve got you covered. If you go to the girls’ restroom on the 4th
floor in Gates, you will see everything you need. Free of charge.</p>

<p><b>Happy smiley’s 35’s birthday!</b></p>

<p>Do you know who invented :-)? Where was :-) first used?</p>

<p>On 19 Sep, 1982, way before the emoji era, Scott Fahlman at CMU decided that people should use :-) for happy
feeling and :-( for sad feeling. When they could only communicate through plain
text, this was the cleverest idea. Now we have emoji, but I’d say text emoticons
are still very useful and efficient. <a href="http://cool-smileys.com/text-emoticons">Here’s a
list of text emoticons</a>. (^o^)/ (◕‿◕✿)</p>

<p>BTW, do you know why CMU’s computer science ranks 1st? Because we invented bug
swatter that can help our students quickly identify bugs so as to accelerate our
research progress!</p>

                <h4 id="wednesday-feburary-21-2018">Wednesday, Feburary 21, 2018</h4>

<p>Jeremy Lacomis presented the paper <b><a href="https://hal.inria.fr/hal-01691496/file/SEIP_63_Camera-Ready-no-copyright.pdf">How
to Design a Program Repair Bot? Insights from
the Repairnator Project</a></b> (Urli et al. ICSE 2018).</p>

<p>It is interesting to learn about online program repair bugs. When I was talking
with a CMU undergrad at one of <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/cmukgb/">KGB</a>’s activity, he was excited
to learn that people are working on how to fix bugs automatically since he has
some very unpleasant experience with debugging - so do many of us. It would be
great if we could have a bug repairing bot with high accuracy in the future.
However, as Marat pointed out, when the debugging process can be largely
substituted by a robot, that means this language is dying. One example is
Assembly. Here’s a quote from Paul Graham
about the evolution of programming languages:</p>

<p>“What programmers in a hundred years will be looking for, most of all, is a
language where you can throw together an unbelievably inefficient version 1 of a
program with the least possible effort. At least, that’s how we’d describe it in
present-day terms. What they’ll say is that they want a language that’s easy to
program in.</p>

<p>Inefficient software isn’t gross. What’s gross is a language that makes
programmers do needless work. Wasting programmer time is the true inefficiency,
not wasting machine time. This will become ever more clear as computers get
faster.” (source: <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/hundred.html">http://www.paulgraham.com/hundred.html</a>)</p>

<h4 id="wednesday-feburary-14-2018">Wednesday, Feburary 14, 2018</h4>

<p>Jason Yanwen Lin presented the paper
<b><a href="http://haiyizhu.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/predicting-member-productivity-1.pdf">Predicting
Member Productivity and Withdrawal from
Pre-Joining Attachments in Online Production Groups</a></b> (Yu et al. CSCW 17).</p>

<p>This paper analysed withdrawl from Wikipedia groups using the attachment
theories from social psychology. 
There results show that pre-joining connections are important to online
production groups. Speaking from my personal experience, I totally agree with
the authors. Especially in online community, when you often interact with people
who you don’t konw much personal information, it can be hard to form attachment.</p>

<h4 id="wednesday-feburary-7-2018">Wednesday, Feburary 7, 2018</h4>

<p>Shurui Zhou presented the paper <b><a href="http://gustavopinto.org/lost+found/icse2018.pdf">Almost There: A Study on
Quasi-Contributors in Open-Source Software Projects</a></b> (Steinmarcher et al.,
ICSE 2018).</p>

<p>It was interesting to learn that many people stopped making further
contribution on GitHub after their first pull request was rejected. We also felt
that there would be many future work worth pursuing. Thanks Shurui’s
presentation as well as her snacks.</p>

<p>Since it was Alex’s meeting before he became a
professor in Estonia, he also brought some
pastries from Gates. We appreciated his intention of getting us fat. We will
miss you.</p>

<p>By the way, I think Gates’ blueberry muffin is very nice, as well as banana &amp;
nuts in Scott. Nevertheless, no muffin compares to thos in Brown’s Blue Room or
banana muffin at Corner Bakery Cafe.</p>

<h4 id="wednesday-janurary-14-2018">Wednesday, Janurary 14, 2018</h4>

<p>David Widder presented the paper <b><a href="https://ir.library.oregonstate.edu/downloads/wh246x964">Open Source
barriers to entry, revisited: A tools perspective</a></b> (Mendez et al. ICSE 2018).</p>

<p>Professor Margaret Burnett’s team has been studying GitHub’s gender inclusive
issues. Since men and women are biologically different statistically, tools
should be designed to cater their different ways of thinking and engaging with
software. I do not think software developing is an inheritly male dominated task. I
believe that getting
more women into software developing is a key to gender equality. Yes, I am a
feminist.</p>

<p>Davis is very good at baking, but I think he should have given out his delicious
brownies at the beginning of his presentation rather than at the end.</p>

<h4 id="thusday-december-5-2017">Thusday, December 5, 2017</h4>

<p>Sophie Qiu presented the paper <b><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1071581916301033">The influence of visual feedback and
gender dynamics on performance,
perception and communication strategies in CSCW</a></b> (Koulouri et al.
International Journal of Human-Computer Studies 2017).</p>

<p>This paper shows that while men are statistically better at navigation with help
from visual signals, women can use verbal communication to compensate such
weakness and achieve the same level of excellency in navitation tasks.
GenderMag, which David Widder will present later, is in the same mindset that
although men and women are statistically biologically different, well-designed
tools can help both of them succeed.</p>

<p>Sophie did not know that green been pie could contain cream so she bought a lot
of them. Luckily, she could bring them to Strudel meetings so that everyone can
eat them and be merry.</p>

<h4 id="tuesday-november-28-2017">Tuesday, November 28, 2017</h4>

<p>Bogdan Vasilescu presented the paper <b><a href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8031982/">Code Coverage and Postrelease
Defects: A Large-Scale Study on Open Source Projects</a></b> (Kochhar et al. 2017).</p>

<p>This paper shows that code coverage in testing has insignificant correlation
with the number of bugs at the project level of a software. Then my question
was: how much test would be sufficient if a large software project could never be
bug-free?</p>

<p>I do not remember what snack we had during that meeting.</p>

<h4 id="tuesday-november-21-2017">Tuesday, November 21, 2017</h4>

<p>Shurui Zhou presented the paper <b><a href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3104225">Some from here, some from
there: cross-project code reuse in GitHub</a></b> (Gharehyazie et al., MSR 2017).</p>

<p>This paper reminds me of two most popular ways of coding: Google-oriented coding
and stackoverflow-oriented coding. It is expensive to write code from scratch,
so understanding how code pieces are cloned across projects is useful.</p>

<p>I do not quite remember the snack but it might be Shurui’s Choco Pie.</p>

<h4 id="tuesday-november-14-2017">Tuesday, November 14, 2017</h4>

<p>Alexander Nolte presented the paper <b><a href="http://hci.stanford.edu/publications/2017/flashorgs/flash-orgs-chi-2017.pdf">Flash Organizations:
Crowdsourcing Complex Work by Structuring Crowds As Organizations</a></b>.</p>

<p>It is a nice paper on how to more effectively form an software developing group.
It was good to read some paper on HCI, which I was fascinated in but knew very
little about.</p>

<p>Thanks for your cookies, Alex. I guess they came from La Prima Espresso in
WEAN.</p>

<h4 id="tuesday-november-7-2017">Tuesday, November 7, 2017</h4>

<p>Alan Jaffe presented the paper <b><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.09492.pdf">Automatically Generating Commit Messages
from Diffs Using Neural Machine Translation</a></b> (Jiang et al., ASE
2017).</p>

<p>It is an interesting application of the naturalness of code. I
learned a lot about the idea of naturalness of code, as well as the fact
that Alan is very good at baking pumpkin pies.</p>

<p>Sophie presented the paper <b><a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~fmri/plosone/files/hp_PLOS_ONE.pdf">Simultaneously
Uncovering the Patterns of
Brain Regions Involved in Different Story
Reading Subprocesses</a></b> (Wehbe et al., PLoS ONE 2014).</p>

<p>The researchers scanned participants brains while they were reading
the ninth chapter of <i>Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone</i>. They
then trained a classifier that can distinguish which short passage the
participants were reading based on the neural activity. The choice of
this paper was to present group members another machine learning
classifier that can process fMRI results. 
It was very nice and sweet that David made apple raisin strudels.</p>

dispersion of social ties: a network analysis of relationship status on
facebook</a></b> (Backstrom et al, CSCW 2014).</p>

<p>This paper proposed to use
dispersion, which measures “the extent to which two people’s mutual
friends are not themselves well-connected,” in addition to embeddedness,
which measures the number of mutural friends, to predict if two Facebook users 
are in a romantic relationship. The accuracy of prediction increased 
significantly when using the dispersion metric.
Somehow, my impression of the paper smells like homemade banana bread.</p>

<p><strong><a href="../papers/swan.pdf">Timezone and Time-of-Day Variance in GitHub Teams: An Empirical Method and 
Study</a></strong>,

Pallavi Kudigrama, and 
<a href="http://web.cs.ucdavis.edu/~rubio/">Cindy Rubio-González</a>

<p>One of the coolest parts of the paper is the novel use of <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directional_statistics">circular 
statistics</a></strong>.
Did you know that traditional summary statistics (like the mean) are invalid for
circular variables like the clock and angles?
Here’s an example of circular histograms showing when people made commits
in two GitHub projects.

<p><em>Abstract</em>:</p>

<p>Open source projects based in ecosystems like GitHub seamlessly allow distributed 
software development. 
Contributors to some GitHub projects may originate from many different timezones; 
in others they may all reside in just one timezone. 
How might this timezone dispersion (or concentration) affect the diurnal 
distribution of work activity in these projects? 
In commercial projects, there has been a desire to use top-down management and 
work allocation to exploit timezone dispersion of project teams, to engender a 
more round-the-clock work cycle. 
We focus on GitHub, and explore the relationship between timezone dispersion 
and work activity dispersion. 
We find that while time-of-day work activity dispersion is indeed associated 
strongly with timezone dispersion, it is equally (if not more strongly) affected 
by project team size.</p>
