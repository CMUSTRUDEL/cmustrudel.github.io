### Diversity in online software teams

Software development is usually a collaborative venture. Open Source Software 
(OSS) projects are no exception; indeed, by design, the OSS approach can 
accommodate teams that are more open, geographically distributed, and dynamic 
than commercial teams. This, we find, leads to OSS **teams that are quite diverse**. 
Team diversity, predominantly in offline groups, is known to correlate with 
team output, mostly with positive effects. How about in OSS?

Using **GitHub**, the largest publicly available collection of OSS projects, 
we studied how gender and tenure diversity relate to team productivity and 
turnover. Using regression modeling of GitHub data and the results of a survey, 
we show that both **gender and tenure diversity are positive and significant 
predictors of productivity**. These results can inform decision making on all 
levels, leading to better outcomes in recruiting and performance.
